# @eos/container

An inversion-of-control container package for registering and autowiring the EOS stack.

## What is this?

An optional approach to wiring the EOS stack is to use the `@eos/container` package. This package provides a container for registering and autowiring the EOS stack. This is useful for applications that require a more dynamic approach to wiring the EOS stack.

When components are registered, the container will automatically resolve the dependencies of the components and wire them together.

## Do I need to use this?

**No**. If you want to construct all of the components of the EOS stack manually, you absolutely can! This package is _entirely optional_ and is provided as a convenience for applications that require a more dynamic approach to wiring the EOS stack.

## Example

```typescript
// TODO: Add example
```
